/*
 * Inheritance in Java:-
 * 1)The process of defining a class to acquire the other class objects into our class and reusing and changing 
 *   its object members using our objects or class name. 
 *   -Here changing means overriding the existed functionality of object or adding more functionality.
 * 2)The main advantages of inheritance is:
 *   -Adding new behaviours by overriding the function. 
 *   -Adding more behaviours by defining the new method.
 *   -To reuse its members by using our class name.
 * 3)By using extends (between two classes or interface) or implements(between class and interface)
 *   We are implementing inheritance relation.
 * 4)Types of Inheritance:-
 *   i]Single level inheritance: If two class or two interfaces or class and interfaces participate in
 *   an inheritance is called Single LEvel Inheritance.
 *   ii]Multilevel Inheritance: If more than two class participate in Inheritance relation vertically
 *   is called multi-level Inheritance.
 *   iii]Hierarchical Inheritance: If we derive multiple subclass from single superclass is called as 
 *   Hierarchical Inheritance.
 *   iv]Multiple Inheritance: Deriving a subclass from multiple superclass is called multiple inheritance.
 *   -Interfaces are mainly used for supporting multiple inheritance

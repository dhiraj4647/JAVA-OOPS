/*
 * We cannot extends final class.
 * final class is used to stop inheritance relation.
 * if class is final then its members are not final. We have to make final member explicitly. 
 * We can modify the value of final class variable if the variables are not final.
 * We are not able to override the final class methods because final class cannot be extends 
 * We can stop creating subclass either buy using final class or making the superclass 
  constructor private.
  WE can also create object of final class

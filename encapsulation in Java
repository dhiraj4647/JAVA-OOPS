/*
 * Encapsulation in java:-
 * 1)The Process of defining a class by hiding its data from direct access from outside class members
 *  and providing access only by using setters and getters method with proper validation and authentication
 *  is called as Encapsulation.
 * 2)We can achieve the data encapsulation by declaring variable as private and defining one pair of setters 
 *  and getters method for that variable.
 * 3)By defining variable as private we restrict its direct access from other class and we are declaring public 
 *  setters and getters method to access the same variable from outside class with proper validation.
 * 4)The main advantage of setters and getters method is that we can validate the user given values before storing it.
 * 5)Below program is used to validate that user given value is not negative.
